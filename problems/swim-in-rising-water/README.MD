https://leetcode.com/problems/swim-in-rising-water/

Input: [[0,2],[1,3]]
Output: 3
Explanation:
At time 0, you are in grid location (0, 0).
You cannot go anywhere else because 4-directionally adjacent neighbors have a higher elevation than t = 0.

You cannot reach point (1, 1) until time 3.
When the depth of water is 3, we can swim anywhere inside the grid.

Example 2:

Input: [[0,1,2,3,4],[24,23,22,21,5],[12,13,14,15,16],[11,17,18,19,20],[10,9,8,7,6]]
Output: 16
Explanation:
0 1 2 3 4
24 23 22 21 5
12 13 14 15 16
11 17 18 19 20
10 9 8 7 6

The final route is marked in bold.
We need to wait until time 16 so that (0, 0) and (4, 4) are connected.

Note:

    2 <= N <= 50.
    grid[i][j] is a permutation of [0, ..., N*N - 1].
