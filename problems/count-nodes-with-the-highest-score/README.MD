https://leetcode.com/problems/count-nodes-with-the-highest-score/

Return the number of nodes that have the highest score.

 

Example 1:

example-1
Input: parents = [-1,2,0,2,0]
Output: 3
Explanation:
- The score of node 0 is: 3 * 1 = 3
- The score of node 1 is: 4 = 4
- The score of node 2 is: 1 * 1 * 2 = 2
- The score of node 3 is: 4 = 4
- The score of node 4 is: 4 = 4
The highest score is 4, and three nodes (node 1, node 3, and node 4) have the highest score.
Example 2:

example-2
Input: parents = [-1,2,0]
Output: 2
Explanation:
- The score of node 0 is: 2 = 2
- The score of node 1 is: 2 = 2
- The score of node 2 is: 1 * 1 = 1
The highest score is 2, and two nodes (node 0 and node 1) have the highest score.
 

Constraints:

n == parents.length
2 <= n <= 105
parents[0] == -1
0 <= parents[i] <= n - 1 for i != 0
parents represents a valid binary tree.
